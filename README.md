# The Head Cook - iOS App built with Swift/SwiftUI and SwiftData

## Introduction
I wanted to build an iOS app using Swift. I decided to build a Recipes App as to be honest, it was the first thing that came to my head. But, I also thought it was a perfect candidate to learn about using Swift/SwiftUI properly (whilst also using data with SwiftData).

## Technologies
- Frontend: Swift/SwiftUI
- Backend/Database: SwiftData (works with iOS 17 or later)
- CI/CD Pipeline: GitHub Actions (coming soon - once the app is ready for dev testing and a staging/beta release)
- VCS: Git

## Features
The Head Cook is not just a recipes app, but also contains features such as meal planning, and the ability to search for other people's recipes.

This app has the ability to create recipes, view recipes, favourite recipes, delete recipes, add ingredients to recipes, create custom ingredients and much more.
